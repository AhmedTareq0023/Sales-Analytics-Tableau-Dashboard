# Sales-Analytics-Tableau-Dashboard
First, I used Excel to clean the dataset.
then launched Tableau to start the amazing analytical and visualization trip.

In order to create the basic data model, I first verified the data types and joined the orders, returns tables.

Then, I developed the needed Measures and Charts that make it easier to analyze data effectively.

I made an effort to monitor the most significant KPIs in the data, including profit, sales and more for products.

I also forecasted the overall revenues for the following Year.

I created Three Interactive Dashboards to summarize the important KPIs in the dataset.

I also created a tableau story to provide context.
